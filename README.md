# AllTheTiers

A work in progress that I hope to update further, which may include big changes to already added entities.

This mod is designed for the experimental branch of the game. It may make use of items not yet in the stable branch.

A mod for desynced which aims to add further tiers to many entities.
Also unlocks higher base game tiers that are not yet accessible.

Currently implemented upgrades:

A whole new tech tree!
This includes some new items to unlock some new tech and used in some creation.
